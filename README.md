## Airdots Double-Tap
##### Adds the functionality to skip songs on double-tap with the "Xiaomi Airdots" (Will work with other earphones that activate personal assistant)
There are other apps with the same functionality (like MacroDroid) But they will keep running in the background.
I personally didn't liked this. Therefore AirdotsDoubleTap app will only run while skipping the song.
