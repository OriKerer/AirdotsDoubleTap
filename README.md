# Airdots Double-Tap
##### Adds the functionality to skip songs on double-tap with the "Xiaomi Airdots"
There are other apps with the same functionality (like MacroDroid) But they will keep running in the background.
I personally didn liked this. Therefore AirdotsDoubleTap app will only run while skipping the song.

#
#### How to use
* Install the app 
* Double tap the airdots 
* The device will ask you with which app to complete the action
* Select always with AirdotsDoubleTap
